The HW-independent portion of the SUI accepts
two user words when registering a SUI element
like an LED or button.  These two user words
are available to the hardware-specific code
you write for the L452+EduBAse routines.

Devise a logical and EXTENSIBLE scheme of 
user data for each LED and switch that allows
for easy "decoding" in your hardware routines
to determine which LED/switch is being addressed.

Be sure you clearly document the usage and meaning
of your user-defined words.
