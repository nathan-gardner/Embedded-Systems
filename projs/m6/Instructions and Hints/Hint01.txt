The files in src/generic_hw/ and include/generic_hw
contain a skeleton of the hardware-specific files you
must create.

Copy the two esos_hwxxx_sui files (the .c and .h) to
your repo.  Rename them:

esos_stm32l4_edub_sui.c and esos_stm32l4_edub_sui.h

Please these two files in a folder in your team repo.
DO NOT PLACE THEM IN YOUR ESOS REPO.  You should have
a folder called "MyESOS" or something similar to contain
your versions of files which extend ESOS with new
functionality.

Add the appropriate references to your m6 Makefile
to use these two files.

Complete the function stubs to implement the basic
hardware interactions with LEDs and switches.

The hardware-independent code for the SUI will do
most of the complex control of the user-interface.
Your application can now call the hardward-independent
API call for the ESOS SUI service.
