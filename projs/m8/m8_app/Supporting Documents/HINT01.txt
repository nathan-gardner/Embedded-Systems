The provided text application uses the
parallel LCD interface. Be sure your
jumper is located in the correct position.
The seven-segment display changes its contents
every second.  The invdividual digit displays
are updated in turn. A digit display is updated
every n milliseconds where n is shown in the
lower-right corner of the LCD.

The seven-segment displays cycles through
the list of undergraduate courses I have
taught over the years.  There is also a mode
where the seven-segments drive each display
in turn with a random number.

The seven-segment display mode and the seven-
segment refresh rate can be altered in a variety
of ways..... try pressing SW2-SW5.

Enjoy!
